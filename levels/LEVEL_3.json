		"WARNING: any of the YELLOW text below does not actually affect the game
		this is just so you can easily recognize what kind of tile you are making
		
		the first number defines the color. set a 0 to make a blank space
		0x: empty space    5x: yellow
		1x: gray           6x: purple
		2x: red            7x: orange
		3x: green          8x: black
		4x: blue           9x: RNG tile
		
		the second number is the attribute of the tile being placed
		x0: sets a regular tile
		x1: sets a bomb
		x2: sets a box
		x3: sets a key
		
		x7: sets the unspawnable attribute. unspawnable tiles wont randomly place  color on that tile
		x8: sets the dynamic camera on/off
		x9: sets the player spawn point. (if there are multiple spawn points in a livel, the last one will be used.)"
